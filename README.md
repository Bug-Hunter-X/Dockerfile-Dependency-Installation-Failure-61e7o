This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to specify a requirements.txt file for dependency installation. The initial Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies directly from the current directory, which is inefficient and will fail if dependencies aren't correctly packaged. The solution adds a requirements.txt file and modifies the CMD instruction to use it for dependency installation.
